- **Bigger Components**: More complex UI elements, such as tables and forms.
- **Smaller Components**: Simpler elements, including action buttons, double-text displays, and more.

## Components

- **Form Component**: A collection of input fields and controls for capturing user input.

### Smaller Components

- **Action Buttons Component**: Interactive buttons for executing actions.
- **Checkboxes Component**: A customizable component for adding multiple checkboxes.
- **Colored Blocks Component**: Blocks of various sizes and colors for UI customization.

You can use these components individually or combine them to create more complex UI elements. For example, to include action buttons within a table component, simply import the action buttons component into your table component file and follow the button's HTML structure.
