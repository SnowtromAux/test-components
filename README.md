# Test Components

Welcome to **Test Components**! This repository contains a collection of reusable components that you can integrate into your projects. They are organized into two categories:

- **Bigger Components**: These include more complex UI elements like tables and forms.
- **Smaller Components**: These consist of simpler elements such as action buttons, double-text displays, and more.

## Components

### Bigger Components

- **Table Component**: A flexible table structure designed to display data dynamically.
- **Form Component**: A set of input fields and controls for capturing user input.

### Smaller Components

- **Action Buttons**: Interactive buttons for executing actions.
- **Double-Text Component**: A component to display two pieces of text with distinct styling.

## Usage

You can use these components individually or nest them to create more complex UI elements. For example, to include the action buttons within a table component, simply import the action buttons component into your table component's file.
